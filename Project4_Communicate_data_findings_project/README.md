## Summary of Findings
> I began my data exploration with observing how the Prosper Score was distributed amongst the dataset, as it is an ordinal category that I wanted to learn more about. The main goal from that point was to further explore the relationship to find which factors determined how high of a prosper score an applicant received, as well as how specifically a higher prsoper score would benefit an applicants loan offer and discovered that the the impact of an approved applicants Prosper Score has more to do with the loan amounts and terms that become available to them when looking at the average loan amount spread across terms and prosper score.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Aside from identifying the impact that the Prosper Score has on an individuals loan status, I simultaneously explored employment status, employment status durations, income amounts and delinquencies/debt information to determine which factors had the most impact on how high or low of a Prosper Score an approved applicant received. I found that the APR is heavily correlated with prosper score mainly when considering employment status. This is not as clear when looking at employment duration, as there is a distinct difference in the average duration of employment status amongst the different categories.I also found that the actual amount of debt owed by an applicant is more important in determining eligibilty than the amount of delinquencies themselves. It is also clear that the lower amount delinquent an individual has in total, the higher their prosper score becomes and the longer loan term options become available.
